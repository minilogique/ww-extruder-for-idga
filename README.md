Had an OEM IDGA gearset laying around and I had nothing else to do with it. Clockwork2 seemed to be unecessarily complex so I opted to butcher WristWatch2 BMG version to make it fit IDGA as it's already fairly similar. Just needed to move the filament path and match the mounting pattern.

Used hardware is identical to WW extruder list except the gearset. Print settings are recommended to be of official Voron spec. Centre of Mass is shifted so it quite possibly will affect your resonance with more aggressive print settings. Parts except idler arm are printed as oriented in the files. Drilling/cleaning filament path with 2mm nail/drillbit might be needed depending of your print quality.

WORK IN PROGRESS!

Update 11.03.2025 - uploaded new models, improved looks and strength, added integrated supports for tension arm model. Once testing is successful, I'll start the work on adding the integrated filament runout sensor. Also added smooth bearing idler arm (11mm outer diameter, 5mm inner diameter, 5mm width, uses M3x16 bolt and M3 washer for mounting). After some iteration I made changes to tensioner arm to make the smooth idler bearing and filament path more visible for looks and for better access when having issues with TPU for example.
